In the coastal village of Lastport, the tides are governed not by the moon, but by a mysterious, slow-breathing Leviathan that slumbers deep in the oceanic trench. The villagers' entire culture and survival are built around the "Great Breath," the decades-long cycle of the tide's ebb and flow. Marin is a young "Tide-Singer," one of the few who can communicate with the Leviathan through complex, sonar-like songs, helping to guide the village's unique, tidal-farming practices. She feels a deep, empathetic connection to the great beast, hearing its dreams as vast, oceanic symphonies.

The equilibrium shatters when a corporate dredge ship, the "Aether Diver," arrives from the advanced, sky-bound cities. They are not interested in fish or territory; they are harvesting "Chrono-Plankton," microscopic organisms that live in the Leviathan's wake and possess mild time-dilating properties. Their intensive harvesting is a violent, screeching assault on the Leviathan's sensitive ecosystem, causing it physical pain and disrupting its breathing cycle. The tides become erratic, storms rage, and Lastport faces destruction. The corporation views the Leviathan as a mere animal, an obstacle to a resource that can make them unimaginably wealthy.

Marin, along with a disgraced corporate biologist named Finn who was exiled for his ethical concerns, must find a way to stop the harvesting. They learn the terrible truth: the Chrono-Plankton are not just a resource; they are part of the Leviathan's immune system and its method of perceiving time. The corporation is literally blinding and sickening a creature that is the linchpin of the planet's temporal stability. The Leviathan's "breath" is what keeps the flow of time constant in this region; without it, time will begin to stutter, loop, and eventually shatter.

The final act is a race against a disintegrating timeline. As the Leviathan weakens, Marin experiences moments from her past and future simultaneously. She must guide Finn's ship, the "Aether Diver," not to fight the corporate armada, but to perform a "Grand Lullaby," a song of such complexity and power that it can soothe the Leviathan back into its stable rhythm. The battle is a symphony, with Marin's organic Tide-Singing harmonizing with the ship's powerful sonar array. They must amplify the song, using the corporation's own Chrono-Plankton harvest as a resonant catalyst, creating a feedback loop of temporal energy that repairs the damage and pushes the corporate ships out of sync with time, leaving them drifting and forgotten in a yesterday they can never escape.
