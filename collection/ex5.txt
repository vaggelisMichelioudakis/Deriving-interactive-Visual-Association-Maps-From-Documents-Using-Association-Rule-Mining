In the city of Aethel, a unique social class has emerged: the "Echoes." These are individuals who were connected via neural link to someone else at the moment of that person's death, capturing a fragmented, emotional imprint of their consciousness. These imprints are not ghosts or full personalities, but more like persistent emotional memories—a lingering sense of regret, a burst of unexpressed love, a phantom pain. Our protagonist, Lila, is the most powerful Echo ever recorded. She wasn't just linked to one person; she was at the center of a train derailment that killed dozens, and in that chaotic moment, she absorbed the final moments of every single victim.

She lives in a state of constant, overwhelming sensory and emotional overload. She feels the architect's despair over his unfinished masterpiece, the young mother's panic for her child (who survived), the thief's grim satisfaction at getting away with his final score. The city views Echoes with a mixture of pity and fascination. A powerful institution, the "Closure Bureau," employs them to help the bereaved find peace, using the Echoes to deliver final messages or solve mysteries surrounding a death. Lila is their most valuable and volatile asset.

The Bureau assigns her to a high-profile case: the death of a renowned and reclusive bio-artist, Aris, who apparently died by suicide. His sister, however, believes he was murdered. When Lila touches one of Aris's personal artifacts, she doesn't get the clear, single imprint of suicide or a violent struggle. Instead, she is flooded with a contradictory cascade of emotions: a deep, cosmic awe, a chilling fear, and a profound, purposeful resolve. It feels less like an end and more like a... transition. This "Echo" is unlike any she has ever felt.

Defying the Bureau, which is eager to close the case and declare it a suicide, Lila uses her connection to the other victims of the train crash—a network of shared trauma that only the Echoes can perceive—to investigate. She pieces together that Aris hadn't killed himself; he had successfully achieved a lifelong goal: to project his consciousness into a non-biological substrate, a "symphony of mycelial networks" he had been cultivating in a hidden lab. His physical body was simply shed, like a cocoon. The awe she felt was his success; the fear was of the unknown; the resolve was his choice to leave. The film becomes a philosophical thriller. Lila must expose the truth, not to accuse a murderer, but to defend a new form of existence. She must convince the world, and the rigid Bureau, that Aris's "death" was actually a transcendence, challenging the very definitions of life, death, and the right to choose one's own evolutionary path, even if it means leaving humanity behind.
