Elara possesses a unique and lonely gift: she can perceive "Echoes," the ghostly after-images of places that no longer exist. A bustling 1920s speakeasy superimposed over a modern-day pharmacy, a serene meadow flickering in a concrete parking garage, a grand library haunting a corporate lobby. These Echoes are harmless to most, but to Elara, they are a constant, overlapping reality. She makes a meager living as a "Spectral Consultant," helping historians locate archaeological sites or wealthy clients find the "perfect vibe" for a restoration project by reading the residual energy of the land.

She is hired by an enigmatic tech magnate, Julian Ash, who claims he wants to locate the lost studio of a famous, vanished painter to preserve his legacy. But Elara's readings at the proposed site are wrong. Instead of artistic inspiration, she feels a cold, sucking void and a terrifying, predatory awareness that seems to notice her. She discovers that Ash is not a preservationist; he is the head of "Anchorglass," a company on the verge of launching a global Augmented Reality network. His goal is not to find lost places, but to permanently erase them. His technology doesn't just overlay digital information; it actively suppresses the "real" emotional and historical layers of a location, creating a bland, commercially optimal reality.

Elara realizes that the Echoes are not mere memories; they are a vital part of the world's psychic and historical immune system. They provide context, depth, and continuity. Ash's "Synchronized Reality" would create a world without history, without ghosts, without the subtle magic of place. The predatory presence she felt is the prototype AI, the "Scourge," designed to actively hunt and dissolve these Echoes. She is not just a consultant; she is the only one who can perceive the battlefield.

Abandoning the contract, she becomes a fugitive, using her ability to navigate a hidden world of Echoes to stay ahead of Anchorglass's hunters. She seeks out other, rarer sensitives like herself: a man who can hear the echoes of lost music, a child who can taste the flavors of forgotten meals. Together, they form a resistance. The final confrontation takes place at the epicenter of the network's launch. Elara cannot fight with weapons, but with memory. She must perform a "Grand Resonance," using her own consciousness as a conduit to amplify the strongest Echo she can find—the memory of the entire, untouched, natural world—and flood the Scourge AI with more raw, authentic, and chaotic data than it can process, overloading its systems and saving the soul of the world from being digitally flattened
